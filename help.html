      <p>
        <strong>Today</strong> is your to-do list for today.
        Start the day by writing down everything you'd like to accomplish.
        As you complete your tasks, simply delete them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Inbox</strong> is where you can capture any thoughts or potential tasks that arise during the day.
        To learn more, see <a href="#adding-tasks-to-your-inbox">Adding tasks to your inbox</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can triage your inbox later in the day.
        Frogtab displays a notification badge to remind you to triage your inbox as soon as it's convenient.
        As you triage your inbox, you'll remove or snooze each task.
        To learn more, see <a href="#triaging-your-inbox">Triaging your inbox</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the beginning of each day, Frogtab automatically:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Moves any remaining tasks from Today to your inbox</li>
        <li>Unsnoozes any snoozed tasks in your inbox</li>
        <li>Adds tasks from your <a href="#setting-up-recurring-tasks">weekly routine</a> to your inbox</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can then triage your inbox and decide what you'd like to accomplish today.
      </p>
      <h2 id="adding-tasks-to-your-inbox">Adding tasks to your inbox</h2>
      <p>
        Frogtab makes it easy to capture any thoughts or potential tasks that arise as you're working through your priorities for the day.
        You don't need to fill in lots of information when you capture a task - you can add the task to your inbox without getting distracted.
      </p>
      <p>
        To add a task to your inbox, use either of the following methods:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Write down the task in your inbox.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Open <a href="/send" target="_blank">Send to Frogtab</a> in a new tab, then write down the task and click the send button.
            This method is great if you want to capture the task without revealing your inbox (e.g., during a meeting).
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By default, Send to Frogtab doesn't work from other devices.
        If you want to capture tasks from other devices, you must first register your primary device.
        After you register your primary device, you'll get a personal URL that you can use to capture tasks from any device.

      <h2 id="triaging-your-inbox">Triaging your inbox</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of triaging your inbox is to make a decision about how to act on each of the tasks that you've captured.
      </p>
      <p>
        To triage your inbox, take one of the following actions for each task in your inbox:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Complete the task immediately, then delete it.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Move the task to Today if you plan to work on it later the same day.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Snooze the task by writing # in front of the task. For example:
          </p>
          <p>
            <img alt="The Inbox view in Frogtab" src="/help-inbox.png" width="480">
          </p>
          <p>
            Frogtab will unsnooze the task at the beginning of the next day.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Move the task to a more appropriate location outside Frogtab (e.g., a calendar event or a topic in a meeting agenda).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Delete the task if it's not particularly important.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As soon as your inbox is empty or only contains snoozed tasks, the notification badge disappears.
      </p>
      <h2 id="setting-up-recurring-tasks">Setting up recurring tasks</h2>
      <p>
        If there are tasks that you usually do on the same day each week, Frogtab can automatically add the tasks to your inbox at the beginning of the appropriate day.
      </p>
      <p>
        To set up recurring tasks:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Open <a href="/week" target="_blank">Weekly Routine</a> in a new tab.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Select a day, then write down the tasks that you usually do on that day.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        After you've finished writing down your tasks, close the tab.
      </p>
      <h2 id="overview-of-data-privacy">Overview of data privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Frogtab stores the following data that you create:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The contents of Today and Inbox</li>
        <li>Recurring tasks from your weekly routine</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your data is stored in your browser and is not sent to a server.
        If you like, you can make a backup of your data.
        To learn more, see <a href="#exporting-your-data">Exporting your data</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to add a task to your inbox but don't want other people to see your inbox, you can use <a href="/send" target="_blank">Send to Frogtab</a> instead of directly writing down the task in your inbox.
      </p>
      <p>
        By default, Send to Frogtab doesn't send any data to a server.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you choose to register your primary device, you'll get a personal URL that you can use to capture tasks from any device.
        To learn more, see <a href="#adding-tasks-to-your-inbox">Adding tasks to your inbox</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your personal URL sends data via a server. Data is encrypted before it reaches the server, and can only be decrypted using a private key that belongs to the registered device.
        The private key is not sent to the server.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, only the registered device is permitted to download the encrypted data from the server.
        As soon as the data has been downloaded, the server deletes the data.
      </p>
      <h2 id="exporting-your-data">Exporting your data</h2>
      <p>
        Your data is stored in your browser.
        If you like, you can make a backup of your data by exporting your data in JSON format.
      </p>
      <p>
        To export your data, click
        <svg width="20px" height="20px" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" color="currentColor"><path d="M3 5h18M3 12h18M3 19h18" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path></svg>
        at the bottom of Frogtab, then choose <strong>Export Your Data</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some browsers are able to directly write to files on your device.
        If your browser supports this feature, Frogtab can automatically back up your data whenever your data changes.
        To start automatically backing up your data, click <strong>Enable Auto-Backup</strong> at the bottom of Frogtab.
